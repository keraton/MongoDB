# 01 - Introduction to MongoDB

## 01.2 - Databases and collections of documents

The **documents** are stored in **collections**. MongoDB does not impose any **restriction scheme** that you need to *respect*.

The **Database** is the set of **collections** that serve a purpose and that share common security measures, replication, and distribution.
 
In the same **server instances** you can contains different databases.

```javascript
{
    "servidor": "datos.acme.com:27017",
    "databases" : [
      {
        "name" : "facturacion",
        "collections" : ["clientes","facturas","cobros"]
      },
      {
        "name" : "almacen",
        "collections" : ["productos","albaranes"]
      }
    ]
}
```
