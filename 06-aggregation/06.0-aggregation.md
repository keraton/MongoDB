## 06 aggregation

## 06.0 aggregate([pipeline])

Queries of aggregation are equivalent to the **group by and having clauses** of SQL.

Is posed as a **pipe** of operations that are fed sequentially.

In each phase, we will implement a series of **operators** to process the data.

### $project
Modifies the input data, by adding, removing or recalculating fields
### $match
Filters the input with the conditions of a query.
### $limit
Gets a specific number of documents
### $skip
Jump documents, is used in conjunction with $limit to paginate
### $unwind
Unfolds an array of internal, to use your data to first level
### $group
It groups documents according to a certain condition.
### $sort
Sorts a set of documents.
### $geoNear
Used with geospatial data.


> It is very important to *place* the operators in a way that will optimize the work and the passage of information from one phase to the next.
